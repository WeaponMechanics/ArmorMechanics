# not be able to manually click to equip these armors, but you can use commands
# to force equip the item. In general, I recommend you keep this as true
Prevent_Illegal_Armor: true

# Settings this to true will cause ArmorMechanics to delete any armor item that
# no longer exists in config. We have this disabled by default, as this may annoy your playerbase

# Whenever you update your armor, I *HIGHLY SUGGEST* you run a /restart on your
# server instead of just a /am reload. This will force all players to relog and
# their armor will be deleted.
Delete_Old_Armor: false

# Settings this to false will give you a *MINOR* performance benefit. However,
# any armor that already exists will no longer be updated if you change it in
# config. If you don't understand those implications, leave this to be true.

# This option will also prevent players from effectively renaming, enchanting
# or modifying your armor, since it will be reset when they wear it.
